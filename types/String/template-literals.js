// template literals allow for expression interpolation
let example = 'example';
`thats a basic ${example}`

// it also allows for writing multiline strings easily
`thats also a \

of multiline strings`

`if you also want to break lines inside the strings\n\
you could add "\\n" to the breaking points 
or simply do a line break without using "\\"`;
